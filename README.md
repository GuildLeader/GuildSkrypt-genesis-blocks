# GuildRep
Official informal blockchain currency for GuildWorx.com

Each GuildRep wallet address should be owned by only one user. The inherent risk of exposing a private key will mitigate people doing so. From the other end we will be verifying ID before sending out a first transaction. Being a type of ID in itself these GuildRep wallets will be coded with a hook system for associating with a number of tokens such as merit badges, company stocks, and more.
